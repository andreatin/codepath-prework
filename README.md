##App Brainstorming
    top 3 apps:
        1. Youtube 
            - Being able to split videos into different sections

        3. iMessage
            - Deleting messages without a trace 
            - Easy Tapbacks 
            - How it connects to all other available apps and even sends pictures directly to iPhoto
        
    My App idea: 
        Mealer - Recipe Ideas based on the ingredients available while also fitting in your diet
        Although there are similar services and appliances that can keep track of your ingredients and supply recipes, this idea stems from people who live under strict diets and must remain under a certain calorie counts, carb amount, or must meed a minimum amount of protein, for example. With this app, you can input the ingredients you have, with estimates of the amount and it can supply you with recipes that you could make with those ingredients.
